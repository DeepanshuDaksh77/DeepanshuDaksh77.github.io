### This is our project for freyhacks hackathon
Sadly we couldn't compelete the whole website on time but most of the work has been done successfully
We wanted to provide detalied introductions for each place but we couldn't finish it all on time so instead of that we inserted lorem ipsum text
we also wanted to add more functionality with javascript and make the website responsive but we couldn't finish it on time .

This is all we could do in few days of the given time hope you like our efforts
